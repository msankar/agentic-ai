# Multi-Agent Architecture Design Exercises

This directory contains exercises focused on designing multi-agent architectures - the foundation of effective agent-based systems.

## Exercise Overview

In this set of exercises, you'll learn to create effective multi-agent system architectures by:

1. Designing role-specific agents with clear responsibilities
2. Creating effective communication flows between agents
3. Establishing appropriate hierarchy and coordination patterns
4. Designing for modularity and extensibility

## Key Concepts

- Agent specialization and role definition
- Information flow patterns (hub-and-spoke vs. peer-to-peer)
- Coordination mechanisms
- System boundaries and interfaces

## Learning Outcomes

By completing these exercises, you'll be able to design clear and effective multi-agent architectures that:
- Have well-defined agent roles and responsibilities
- Implement efficient communication patterns
- Scale appropriately for the given use case
- Provide clear interfaces for future extension
