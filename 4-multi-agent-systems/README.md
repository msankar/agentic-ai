# Course 4: Multi-Agent Systems

## Overview
This course focuses on the design and implementation of multi-agent systems, where multiple autonomous agents work together to solve complex problems. You will learn how to create coordinated teams of AI agents that can perform tasks collaboratively, manage data flow, and handle state coordination.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into several key sections:

1. **Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Understand the fundamentals of multi-agent systems and their applications in various domains.

2. **Agent Architecture and Design**
   - Learn about different architectures for multi-agent systems, including reactive, deliberative, and hybrid approaches.

3. **Agent Communication**
   - Explore communication protocols and languages used for agent interaction, including message passing and shared knowledge bases.

4. **Coordination and Collaboration**
   - Study techniques for coordinating agents to work together effectively, including task allocation and negotiation strategies.

5. **Implementation in Python**
   - Gain hands-on experience implementing multi-agent systems using Python, including libraries and frameworks that facilitate development.

6. **Final Project**
   - Apply your knowledge in a capstone project where you will design and implement a multi-agent system to solve a real-world problem.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Design and implement multi-agent systems that can work collaboratively.
- Understand and apply various coordination and communication strategies.
- Utilize Python libraries to create functional multi-agent systems.

# Multi-Agent Systems Skill Scorecard

## Overview
This scorecard outlines the core concepts, design, implementation, orchestration, data management, and advanced techniques related to Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). It serves as a guide to evaluate skills and knowledge in building effective multi-agent systems.

## Core Concepts of Multi-Agent Systems

### 1. Explain the Core Concepts
- **Definition**: A multi-agent system is a system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. 
- **Real-World Analogies**:
  - **Restaurant**: Each waiter (agent) takes orders, communicates with the kitchen (orchestrator), and serves food to customers. The kitchen prepares meals based on the orders received.
  - **Hospital**: Different healthcare professionals (agents) like doctors, nurses, and pharmacists work together to provide patient care. Each has specific roles and responsibilities, collaborating to ensure patient health.

### 2. Key Components
- **Agents**: Autonomous entities that perceive their environment and act upon it.
- **Orchestrators**: Components that manage and coordinate the actions of agents.
- **Tools**: Resources that agents use to perform tasks, such as databases, APIs, or external services.

## Design Multi-Agent Architecture

### 1. Create Architectural Diagrams
- Design clear diagrams that map out agent roles and responsibilities within the system.

### 2. Design Information Flow
- Define how information and commands flow between agents for complex tasks.

### 3. Choose Architectural Patterns
- Select appropriate architectural patterns (e.g., orchestrator or peer-to-peer) based on the specific problem being addressed.

## Implement Agents in Python

### 1. Translate Design into Code
- Convert architectural designs into functional agent classes using Python.

### 2. Write Effective System Prompts
- Develop system prompts that clearly define each agent's role, personality, and limitations.

### 3. Equip Agents with Tools
- Integrate tools that allow agents to interact with external data sources and APIs.

## Orchestrate Complex Workflows

### 1. Manage Agent Activities
- Coordinate the activities of multiple agents to achieve a common goal.

### 2. Implement Logic
- Use sequential, parallel, and conditional logic to create robust and flexible workflows.

### 3. Build Orchestrators
- Develop orchestrators that can intelligently delegate tasks to the appropriate specialist agent.

## Manage Data Flow and State

### 1. Design Routing Systems
- Create systems that route information to the correct agent based on content and priority.

### 2. Manage Memory
- Implement both short-term (ephemeral) and long-term (persistent) memory for agents.

### 3. Build Stateful Systems
- Develop systems where agents can remember past interactions and make context-aware decisions.

## Build Advanced Agentic Systems

### 1. Implement State Coordination
- Use techniques to prevent conflicts when multiple agents access shared resources.

### 2. Construct Multi-Agent RAG Systems
- Design and implement a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to synthesize information from multiple sources.

### 3. End-to-End Solution
- Design, build, test, and document a comprehensive multi-agent solution for a real-world business problem.
