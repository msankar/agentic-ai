# Course 4: Multi-Agent Systems

## Overview
This course focuses on the design and implementation of multi-agent systems, where multiple autonomous agents work together to solve complex problems. You will learn how to create coordinated teams of AI agents that can perform tasks collaboratively, manage data flow, and handle state coordination.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into several key sections:

1. **Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Understand the fundamentals of multi-agent systems and their applications in various domains.

2. **Agent Architecture and Design**
   - Learn about different architectures for multi-agent systems, including reactive, deliberative, and hybrid approaches.

3. **Agent Communication**
   - Explore communication protocols and languages used for agent interaction, including message passing and shared knowledge bases.

4. **Coordination and Collaboration**
   - Study techniques for coordinating agents to work together effectively, including task allocation and negotiation strategies.

5. **Implementation in Python**
   - Gain hands-on experience implementing multi-agent systems using Python, including libraries and frameworks that facilitate development.

6. **Final Project**
   - Apply your knowledge in a capstone project where you will design and implement a multi-agent system to solve a real-world problem.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Design and implement multi-agent systems that can work collaboratively.
- Understand and apply various coordination and communication strategies.
- Utilize Python libraries to create functional multi-agent systems.
