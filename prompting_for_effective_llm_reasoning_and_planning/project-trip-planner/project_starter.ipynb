    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

    "   - **Equipment** necessary for the activity\n",
    "   - **dress code**,\n",
    "   - **audience expectations**\n",
    "2. Analyze the **weather conditions**, including:\n",
    "   - Temperature (e.g., hot, chilly, cold)\n",
    "   - Precipitation (e.g., rain, thunderstorms, snow)\n",
    "   - Wind, humidity, cloud cover, or any environmental discomfort\n",
    "3. Evaluate whether the **activity can be safely and comfortably performed** under these conditions.\n",
    "   - Even mild discomfort (e.g. rain for an active outdoor event) should be considered **IS_INCOMPATIBLE**.\n",
    "4. Consider any **backup or indoor alternatives**  mentioned in the activity description.\n",
    "   - If a safe fallback is available, the activity may still be **IS_COMPATIBLE**.\n",

Yuri is 30 years old with interests in tennis, cooking, comedy, and technology, while Hiro is 25 and enjoys reading, music, theatre, and art. They will be visiting AgentsVille from June 10 to June 12, 2025, with a total budget of 130 and a total planned cost of 123. The itinerary is thoughtfully designed to suit their interests while considering the weather conditions each day.\n\nOn June 10, the weather in AgentsVille is clear with warm temperatures, ideal for outdoor activities. The day begins with the FutureTech Breakfast Meet-Up at the Innovation Atrium, a perfect indoor event centered around technology that aligns well with Yuri's interests. Following that, there is the \"Serve & Savor: Tennis and Taste Luncheon,\" which cleverly combines tennis and cooking—a great match for Yuri’s passion for both in an outdoor setting. Later in the afternoon, the \"Artful Athletics: Paint & Play Extravaganza\" offers a creative and active experience outdoors, appealing to Hiro’s love of art while also incorporating sports elements. This variety ensures both travelers can engage with activities they enjoy in comfortable environments.\n\nOn June 11, the day will be partly cloudy with warm temperatures, suitable for a mix of indoor and outdoor plans. The Tech Lunch & Learn event at The Digital Atrium is a fantastic indoor option focused on technology, again catering to Yuri's interests and providing a comfortable setting despite the weather. In the afternoon, the AgentsVille Art & Music Fusion Fest takes place outdoors at the Echo Gardens Amphitheater, blending live music and interactive art installations—an ideal combination that resonates with Hiro’s enjoyment of art and music, making for an inspiring and lively experience.\n\nOn the final day, June 12, the forecast predicts thunderstorms, so the itinerary focuses on indoor-friendly options. The Soundtrack Picnic at the Starlight Amphitheater features classic movie scenes paired with live music and includes a smooth transition indoors if the weather worsens. This event connects well to both travelers' love for music and movies. Later in the evening, the Tech & Film Fusion Night at the Virtual Reality Theater offers an immersive fusion of technology and cinema, engaging Yuri’s tech enthusiasm alongside Hiro’s interest in movies. This event creates a fitting and exciting conclusion to the trip, providing a rich multimedia experience sheltered from the stormy weather.\n\nOverall, the itinerary balances both Yuri and Hiro’s interests across technology, art, music, sports, and culinary experiences while thoughtfully adapting to daily weather conditions, making for a well-rounded and enjoyable visit to AgentsVille."
