# Project: AgentsVille Trip Planner

## Overview
In this project, you will step into the role of an AI Engineer and construct a sophisticated, multi-stage AI assistant: the **AgentsVille Trip Planner**.

### The Scenario: Your Adventure in AgentsVille Awaits!
Imagine a traveler eager to explore the unique (though entirely fictional) city of AgentsVille. They have a set of preferences â€“ perhaps a long weekend focused on art galleries and technology meetups, or a week-long dive into cultural experiences and street food, all within a specific budget. **They turn to your AI-powered Trip Planner for help.**

### Project Goals
Your challenge is to build an AI system that can:
1. **Understand and Interpret**: Take into account user preferences and constraints.
2. **Plan Comprehensively**: Generate a detailed, day-by-day itinerary that is not just a list of activities but a coherent plan tailored to the individual travelers.
3. **Evaluate and Enhance**: Refine the itinerary by intelligently using a set of tools to evaluate the plan, fetch new information, and refine the schedule.

This isn't just about getting a Large Language Model (LLM) to output text; it's about designing a system that reasons, plans, and interacts with "external" information sources to provide a truly helpful trip planning experience.

### Project Description
Your "AgentsVille Trip Planner" will be a Jupyter Notebook application that orchestrates interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform two main functions:

1. **The Expert Planner (Initial Itinerary Generation)**:  
   - **Your Task**: Based on a set of user-defined travel preferences (destination, duration, interests, budget), you will prompt the AI to act as an expert travel planner.  
   - **The Outcome**: The AI must generate a detailed, day-by-day travel itinerary for AgentsVille. This itinerary needs to be a structured JSON object that conforms to a predefined Pydantic model.

2. **The Resourceful Assistant (Itinerary Enhancement with a Tool-Using ReAct Agent)**:  
   - **Your Task**: Once an initial itinerary is generated, the user might have follow-up questions or request modifications. You will design an "AI Travel Assistant".
   - **The Outcome**: This agent will analyze the user's request in the context of the current itinerary and decide if any of its available "tools" can assist. The agent will **THINK**, **ACT**, and **OBSERVE** to refine the itinerary.

## Conclusion
This project will enhance your skills in AI development, prompt engineering, and system design, allowing you to create a practical application that showcases your understanding of multi-agent systems and user interaction.
