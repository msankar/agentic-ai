This keeps them visible but contained.\n- Limit the number of sentimental items on your desk to 3-5 favorites to avoid overcrowding.\n\n### Step 3: Organize Essentials (5 minutes)\n- Use a desk organizer or caddy to store pens, notepads, and frequently used tools.\n- Keep only daily-use electronics or chargers on the desk; store others elsewhere.\n\n### Step 4: Deal with Other Clutter (2 minutes)\n- Quickly sort the remaining clutter: file important papers, recycle trash, and store rarely used items away.\n- If you donâ€™t have a filing system, use an inexpensive file folder or box within your budget.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus Tips:\n- Vertical space is your friend. Use wall-mounted organizers or small shelves if possible.\n- Keep a small trash/recycling bin nearby to maintain cleanliness.\n\nYouâ€™ll have a tidy, functional desk and preserved sentimental itemsâ€”all within your time and budget!

    "1. **Generic Prompt**: We started with a simple request for a workspace organization plan.\n",
    "2. **Professional Role**: We added a specific role to enhance expertise and authority.\n",
